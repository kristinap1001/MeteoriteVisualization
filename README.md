This code is an animated visualization of a dataset containing over 38,000 meteorite landings from the Meteoritical Society's [Meteorite Landings database](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/explore). This was part of a larger group project for my senior year Big Data class, where I was in charge of generating the visualization on a supercomputer cluster using PySpark and Plotly. The final product can be seen [here](https://kristinap1001.github.io/MeteoriteVisualization/animation.html). You can let the animation play, or use the slider on the bottom of the screen to jump to a specific year. You can also click and drag on the globe (while the animation is not currently playing) or use the controls at the top right of the screen to move around the globe.
